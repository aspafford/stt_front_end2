### Milestone 6: End-to-End Testing & Final Polish
#### Objective
To ensure the component is robust, bug-free, and meets the "Kinetic & Vibrant" creative direction by implementing a full suite of E2E tests and adding the final micro-interactions.

#### User Story / Spec Reference
*   **Delight: Micro-interactions & States:** Implement the "breathing" animation, text fade-in, and loading shimmer.
*   **Success Metrics:** The user interaction is smooth, intuitive, and aligns with the "modern and fun" directive.
*   **UX Spec:** The component must handle all specified user flows reliably.

#### Technical Implementation Plan

1.  **Implement Micro-interactions (CSS):**
    *   **Breathing Animation:** In the `RecordButton`'s CSS module, create a `keyframes` animation for the "breathing" effect on the `stop-circle` icon's container or a pseudo-element. Apply this animation conditionally when the status is `recording`.
    *   **Text Fade-in:** In the `TranscriptionDisplay`'s CSS, add a `keyframes` animation for opacity and a slight transform (`translateY`). Apply this to newly added text. This may require splitting the transcription text into spans of words and applying the animation as they are added. *Self-correction: A simpler approach is to apply the animation to the entire display area whenever the text content changes.*
    *   **Loading Shimmer:** Create a CSS shimmer/skeleton animation using a moving gradient background. Apply this as an overlay on the `TranscriptionDisplay` when the component is in the `loading` state.
2.  **Comprehensive E2E Testing (Playwright):**
    *   Write test specs for each user flow defined in `UX_Spec.md`.
    *   **`happy-path.spec.ts`:**
        *   Test the full, successful transcription flow.
        *   Assert that the button text, icons, and status indicators are correct at each stage.
        *   Assert that the final transcription text is displayed.
    *   **`permissions.spec.ts`:**
        *   Test the flow where the user denies microphone permission.
        *   Use Playwright's context options to deny permission.
        *   Assert that the correct error message and UI state are shown.
    *   **`api-errors.spec.ts`:**
        *   Test the flow where the backend API is unavailable.
        *   Mock the API route to return a 500 server error.
        *   Assert that the correct error message is shown.
3.  **Final Code Review and Refactoring:**
    *   Review all code for clarity, consistency, and adherence to React best practices.
    *   Ensure all props are typed correctly.
    *   Remove any console logs or temporary developer tools.
    *   Add comments to complex sections of code (e.g., the `useRecorder` hook).

#### File Manifest
*   `src/components/RecordButton.module.css` (modified)
*   `src/components/TranscriptionDisplay.module.css` (modified)
*   `tests-e2e/happy-path.spec.ts` (new)
*   `tests-e2e/permissions.spec.ts` (new)
*   `tests-e2e/api-errors.spec.ts` (new)

#### Acceptance Criteria / Tests
1.  **Animations:** The specified "breathing" icon, text fade-in, and loading shimmer animations must be implemented and working correctly.
2.  **E2E Test Suite:** All Playwright tests must pass reliably. The test suite must cover the happy path, permission denial, and API failure scenarios.
3.  **Final Product:** The final component must be a polished, robust, and complete implementation of all provided specifications (`Product_Brief.md`, `UX_Spec.md`, `Creative_Specification.md`).
4.  **Cross-Browser Check:** Manually test the component in the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
