# RETROSPECTIVE

## Milestone 1 - Setup Containerized Development Environment & Testing Harness
**Completed**: 2025-08-08

### Summary
Successfully established a complete containerized development environment using Vite, React, TypeScript, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. The project now has both unit testing (Vitest) and e2e testing (Playwright) fully configured and working. Dev container configuration enables consistent development across different environments.

### Challenges
- **Initial Vite Setup Issue**: The interactive `npm create vite` command was blocked due to non-empty directory prompt. Resolved by manually creating all Vite configuration files and project structure.
- **TypeScript Configuration Error**: `tsconfig.node.json` had conflicting `noEmit: true` with composite project setup. Fixed by removing the noEmit flag.
- **ESLint Configuration**: Initially used incorrect extends syntax `@typescript-eslint/recommended` instead of `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended`. Fixed the configuration format.
- **Test Separation**: Vitest was attempting to run Playwright test files, causing conflicts. Resolved by properly excluding e2e tests from Vitest configuration.

### Technical Notes
- Vite server configured to run on `host: 0.0.0.0` for container accessibility on port 5173
- Vitest configured with jsdom environment and @testing-library/jest-dom setup
- Playwright configured to test against Chrome, Firefox, and Safari with automatic dev server startup
- ESLint configured with TypeScript support and exclusion of e2e test files
- Dev container includes Node.js 20 with VS Code extensions for TypeScript, Prettier, ESLint, Playwright, and Vitest

### Future Improvements
- **Dependency Management**: Consider updating to latest versions of ESLint (v9) and related tooling to avoid deprecation warnings
- **Testing Setup**: The manual creation of Vite files could be streamlined by using a custom project template or better automation
- **Container Optimization**: Dev container could specify more precise VS Code extension versions for better reproducibility
- **Error Handling**: Better error handling for the interactive CLI prompts in automated environments
- **Node Version**: Consider updating to Node.js 20.19+ to meet Vite's recommended engine requirements
