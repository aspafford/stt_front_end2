# PRODUCT BRIEF

**Project Name:** Speech-to-Text UI Component
**Date:** July 23, 2025

## 1. Product Vision & Objective
To create a polished, modern, and intuitive user-facing React component that provides a seamless and engaging way for users to interact with our live speech-to-text transcription service. This component will serve as the primary user interface for the existing `speech-to-text-api-service`.

## 2. Target Audience
*   **Primary:** End-users of web applications who need to transcribe spoken audio in real-time.
*   **Secondary:** Developers integrating this component into their own React-based applications.

## 3. Core Features & User Stories
*   **As a user, I want to start and stop audio recording with a single click** so that I can easily control the transcription process.
*   **As a user, I want to see clear visual feedback when the application is recording my voice** so that I am confident the system is working.
*   **As a user, I want to see the transcribed text appear on the screen in near real-time** as I speak.
*   **As a user, I want to be clearly notified if the application cannot access my microphone or if the transcription service is unavailable** so that I can troubleshoot the problem.

## 4. Technical Requirements
*   **Framework:** The component must be built using React.
*   **API Integration:** The component must successfully interact with the existing backend service by sending a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/transcribe` endpoint located at `http://localhost:8000`.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Must function correctly on the latest versions of modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   **Permissions:** The component must handle browser microphone permissions gracefully, prompting the user for access when required.
*   **State Management:** The component must manage its internal states (e.g., idle, recording, error) effectively.

## 5. Success Metrics
*   **Functionality:** The component successfully captures audio, sends it to the API, and displays the returned transcription with 100% reliability.
*   **User Experience:** The user interaction is smooth, intuitive, and aligns with the "modern and fun" directive.
*   **Performance:** The real-time transcription display has minimal perceived latency.
*   **Integration:** The component is self-contained and can be easily integrated into other React applications.
